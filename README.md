testbase
========

Simple PhpUnit tests Html test runner.
Currently code *is a mess*, as I am using this for years and I am happy with it.

Features
========

- runs PhpUnit tests and outputs HTML
- can be run from PhpEd, so you can easily debug your code while testing
- tries to make sentences from test names
- opens file in your editor, if editor:// scheme exists (same as in Nette Framework)

Now it is for my personal use, but I plan to heavilly refactor this in (near?) future...
